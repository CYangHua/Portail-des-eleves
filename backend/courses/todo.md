# Course management

Do an endpoint to modify questions

## Short term planning

## TODOS :

1. Tags for the courses
2. Teachers
3. Grading as forms (should be as general as possible)



* Find a way so that people only vote once
* Sort people's opinions ?
* Add pre-defined fields for the uploads (exercices, palums and stuff)
* Restrict the type of things that can get uploaded
* Replace by slugfields 
* Add __str__ in models

## Frontend

For the form modification
* Allow to modify each field sort of independently
